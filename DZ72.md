# Домашнее задание к занятию 7.2

1. Ответ на вопрос: при помощи какого инструмента (из разобранных на прошлом занятии) можно создать свой образ ami?

Можно использовать Packer.

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding latest version of yandex-cloud/yandex...
- Installing yandex-cloud/yandex v0.75.0...
- Installed yandex-cloud/yandex v0.75.0 (unauthenticated)

The following providers do not have any version constraints in configuration,
so the latest version was installed.

To prevent automatic upgrades to new major versions that may contain breaking
changes, we recommend adding version constraints in a required_providers block
in your configuration, with the constraint strings suggested below.

* yandex-cloud/yandex: version = "~> 0.75.0"


Warning: Interpolation-only expressions are deprecated

  on main.tf line 50, in resource "yandex_compute_instance" "vm-count":
  50:       image_id = "${yandex_compute_image.ubu-img.id}"

Terraform 0.11 and earlier required all non-constant expressions to be
provided via interpolation syntax, but this pattern is now deprecated. To
silence this warning, remove the "${ sequence from the start and the }"
sequence from the end of this expression, leaving just the inner expression.

Template interpolation syntax is still used to construct strings from
expressions when the template includes multiple interpolation sequences or a
mixture of literal strings and interpolations. This deprecation applies only
to templates that consist entirely of a single interpolation sequence.

(and one more similar warning elsewhere)

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
vagrant@vagrant:~/terraform72$

terraform plan

Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be
persisted to local or remote state storage.

Terraform 0.11 and earlier required all non-constant expressions to be

silence this warning, remove the "${ sequence from the start and the }"
sequence from the end of this expression, leaving just the inner expression.

mixture of literal strings and interpolations. This deprecation applies only
to templates that consist entirely of a single interpolation sequence.

Note: You didn't specify an "-out" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform
can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if
"terraform apply" is subsequently run.

Warning: Interpolation-only expressions are deprecated

  on main.tf line 51, in resource "yandex_compute_instance" "vm-count":
  51:       image_id = "${yandex_compute_image.ubu-img.id}"

Terraform 0.11 and earlier required all non-constant expressions to be
provided via interpolation syntax, but this pattern is now deprecated. To
silence this warning, remove the "${ sequence from the start and the }"
sequence from the end of this expression, leaving just the inner expression.

Template interpolation syntax is still used to construct strings from
expressions when the template includes multiple interpolation sequences or a
mixture of literal strings and interpolations. This deprecation applies only
to templates that consist entirely of a single interpolation sequence.

Do you want to perform these actions in workspace "prod"?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.
